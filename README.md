Kickstarter success

## BUSINESS PROBLEM 
An angel investor company has approached our data science company to help them find out what it takes to make a kickstarter project a success or a failure on the kickstarter platform which is a global crowdfunding platform that gives you access to backers from different parts of the world and they pledge a certain amount of money to help your project realise its goals in terms of amount needed to fulfill the project.
This is a all or nothing approach which means if you do not realise your goal amount within the certain deadline, it is a failure and the money is returned back to the backers. Our customer which is looking to back some projects on the platform but they need our help to answer four business questions that will be give them insights into what kind of projects to back and most importantly develop a classifier model that can predict the success or failure of a project on the kickstarter platform.
